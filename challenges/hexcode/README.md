## Hexcode Golfbot challenge

Our [Hexbot](https://github.com/noops-challenge/hexbot) has delivered millions of hexcodes to challengers across the globe. We're using JavaScript, but what if Hexbot wanted to speak other languages?

The lovely thing about hexcodes is that they're only six characters. How concisely can you generate all 16,777,216 hexcodes in the language of your choice?

### Instructions

Write a hexcode generator that, given enough iterations, is capable of generating all 16,777,216 possibilities of *valid* hexcodes, in less than 256 characters.

Running the program in the terminal or console should a *valid* hexcode every time.
