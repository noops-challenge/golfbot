## String Calculator Golfbot challenge

Computers are really great at math, but only if you give them the equation in a format they understand.

We've provided two sets of problems written out as wordsâ€”the first with numbers from one to nine, the second from one to ninety-nine.

In the language of your choosing, and in as few characters as possible, write a program that parses the problem and returns the correct answer (provided below).

The set of operations are: `plus`, `minus`, `times`, `divided by`.

Note that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.

### Easy Set
Numbers are between 1 and 9.

```
problemSet = [
  "six minus three minus five times nine divided by five plus nine plus two",
  "four divided by one times three minus two plus nine plus seven minus six",
  "two plus five minus six times one divided by seven times four times six",
  "nine divided by two plus eight plus eight plus nine minus five divided by nine",
  "seven minus six divided by five minus four plus six divided by seven plus four",
  "three times four minus one times one divided by seven minus five times eight",
  "eight minus one divided by nine plus eight divided by eight divided by two times eight",
