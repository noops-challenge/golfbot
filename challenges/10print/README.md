## 10Print Golfbot challenge

[10Print](https://10print.org/) is a lovely little program that's just 38 characters long but generates infinite possibilities. Here's the code in Commodore 64 BASIC:

```10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10```

When you run the code (on a Commodore 64), it prints a little maze on screen, like this:

### Instructions

Implement 10print in the language of your choice, in less than 256 characters. Running the program in the terminal or console should yield the pattern.
