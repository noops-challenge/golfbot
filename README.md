# 👋 Meet Golfbot

*"Brevity is the soul of great code"*—Shakespeare (pretty sure).

Ever tried code golf? The game is to use as few characters as possible to do as much as possible.

We're starting out easy with 256 characters—and in the final week, we're dropping it down to 128 characters.

Start practicing your putting, and share your entry with other challengers to see if they can make it even shorter.

## ⛳️ What can you do?

Well, anything—and very little.

Looking for inspiration? [10Print](https://10print.org/) is a lovely little program that's just 38 characters long but generates infinite possibilities.

Here's the code in Commodore 64 BASIC:

```10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10```

When you run the code (on a Commodore 64), it prints a little maze on screen, like this:

We love this program so much we've incorporated it into the design of Meet the Noops: go [here](https://noopschallenge.com/10print) for a full, animated version of 10print, written in JavaScript.

## How Golfbot works

There's no API for this challenge, and we're going to try something a little different. We're inviting you to submit solutions to the challenges as pull requests.

#### **Choose a challenge**

The first is implementing 10print in the language of your choice, in less than 256 characters. Running the program in the terminal or console should yield the pattern.

#### **Submit your solution as a Pull Request**

In the repo we have a challenges folder, with "10print" inside it.

In your pull request, create a new folder with your GitHub username, like so: `/challenges/10print/entries/{github-username}`

Add your code, a README, and a screenshot of the code.

If Golfbot likes it, we'll merge it into master.

We'll add more challenges over time. If you have an idea for a challenge, add an issue.

## ✨ Some places to looks for inspiration.
